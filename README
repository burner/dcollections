DOCUMENTATION

All documentation for dcollections is in ddoc, and can be seen online at
http://www.dsource.org/projects/dcollections/docs/current

BUILDING

To build libdcollections.a or dcollections.lib, run the build script (either
build-lib-linux.sh or build-lib-win32.bat)

Move libdcollections.a or dcollections.lib to a directory in your link path, or
add the following to your dmd.conf file under the DFLAGS line:

-L-Lpath/to/library -L-ldcollections

or in your sc.ini file:

LIB=...;path/to/library
DFLAGS=... -L+dcollections.lib

where the ... represents what's there now.

Then copy the dcollections source tree to wherever you have your import tree.
Otherwise, add a -Ipath/to/dcollections to the appropriate config file for your
system
